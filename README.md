# Rijkswaterstaat library (WIP)
This is a work in progress and uploaded for syncing's sake.

If you want you can work on it, so am I.

## What is it?
So far it only retrieves the current sensors used by Rijkswaterstaat in 10 minute intervals. It contains 5 values as well as a prediction, if available.

All of the data is rather flaky and so is the library. Let's try to fix that!

## Idea
The idea is to perhaps one day put all the data in a database so you can query it with an API and have it return JSON.
